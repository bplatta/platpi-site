# platpi-site
Personal website.

Contains:
- projects page to show current state of my projects `content/projects/`
- about page for brief intro `content/about`
- blog for posting thoughts `content/posts`

Built with [hugo](http://gohugo.io/)
- created a theme `hugo-simpl`. Currently contains a lot of me-specific code. May extract that and contribute the theme to public list in the future.
