Platpi Software builds software that serve its users. Our goals when building applications are <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy" target="_blank">simplicity</a>, efficacy and honesty. Technology should be designed with the <a href="https://www.calmtech.com" target="_blank">best interests</a> of its users in mind. It should complete its task and step aside.

Crucial to this are honest business models that align the product development and motives of the company with the interests of the user. When we launch apps, this will be kept in mind. We also do contract work, specializing in application development and building out predictive analytics tools or feature sets.

Despite the pronoun usage above, Platpi is just I, Ben Platta. You can get in touch by emailing me `ben` at this domain `platpi.com`.
