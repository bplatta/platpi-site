Truth be told, there is no 'Us'. It is only me, Ben Platta. My running hypothesis is that I can do more good in this world creating applications for people. Platpi apps is the house for those applications.

My goals when building applications are [simplicity](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) and efficacy. Technology should get out of our way. I believe, very often, applications tend toward negative outcomes for their users simply due to the business model of the company and the incentives they face. I hope to sustain my applications with sensible business models that [suit their users](https://www.calmtech.com) (read - not advertising).

You'll notice I have a blog. Listen, I'm well aware of the amount of noise on the interwebs. I don't mean to contribute (Oh, really Ben? You have a page on your 'philosophy', how is that not noise?). It's mainly a place to track my thinking. I attempted to do something like this with a [github repository](https://github.com/bplatta/ton42) but I failed in trying to make a habit out of it. The public nature of this blog will force me to clean up my thoughts (even if I don't think anyone will peruse them).
