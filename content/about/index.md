Platpi is just I, Ben Platta. Platpi apps is the house for some applications I'm working on.

My goals when building applications are [simplicity](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) and efficacy. Technology should get out of our way. I think applications often tend toward negative outcomes for their users simply due to the business model of the company and the incentives they face. My goal is to avoid those business models and instead build tech that works [for its users](https://www.calmtech.com).

You'll notice I have a blog. Listen, I'm well aware of the amount of noise on the interwebs. I don't mean to contribute. It's mainly a place to track my thinking.
