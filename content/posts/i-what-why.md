This is my take on making sense of things.

Making sense of things is hard business. Broadly speaking it's trying to answer the ole Who, What, Why: Who am I, What am I doing and Why am I doing that. There is a natural ordering of entailment here. That is, you can't really answer the "why" without defining a) what it is you are doing and b) the subject "I". Of course (b) is frequently glossed over. From a simple definitional stance, the question "Why am I doing what I'm doing" makes no sense without (a) and (b). I've typically never thought about it like this. I've usually started with the "what". But I've come to realize the "I" question is very important and should probably be answered first.

#### Why I first?
```
I = intelligence + humor + german + midwesterner + good soccer player + catholic + ... 
```

This equation makes no sense. Stay with me here. These are some examples of things I have historically wrapped up into my identity, my ego, my concept of self. The wishy-washy-ness of those variables is a problem. Namely, if I find myself doubting my intelligence I am actually doubting myself. That's painful. That person is way better at soccer than me... I guess I'm not the "good soccer player" here. Simplistic but the point: our evaluation of those metrics depend on how we compare to others (we tend to be very zero sum thinkers - more on that later). I
I want people to think I'm smart. Clearly I'd benefit from a world where people thought I was smart. It was an imposed ordering of the world when I was younger. As a child I was given a letter grade and there was ordering amongst myself and my classmates. In highschool, the resolution increased: I was given a GPA and now you could effectively rank every kid in the school. I'm not taking issue with the education system here, I'm pointing out that this way of conceptualizing the world and your place in it takes a toll. I was socialized in the  U.S. which is an incredibly competitive culture. It is the cult of capitalism. Now, pause: I'm not decrying capitalism here. Its likely our best approximation of an economy that can sustain progress and provide citizens with ample opportunity (in it's ideal, thats certainly not how the currently levied system works). My point is that the cult of capitalism and its underarching axioms have imbued our culture and its subscribers with a fierce competitive drive. I will make no 

An expected retort: "competition has been a pillar of culture for time everlasting for the simple fact that it derives its force from human nature, not some top down process". Ok. Mayhaps. This assumes away complexity. The real question is, are we competing along the right dimensions? 

This is part of why recognizing the `I` equation is so important. The "I" answer provides the  context by which we answer the "what" and the "why". There is other context imposed of course. That is to say, I'm not the only person on this planet (presumably). The upshot here is that it's our choice: What to wrap into "I", How to interpret the raw sense datum we recieve.

#### Ok then, how to define `I`?

#### What now?

#### Heavens why?

Some of you might be wondering why were answering "why" after "what". Or perhaps, that we basically already did the "why" thinking. Well now we have a change to engage in the all too human endeavor of post-hoc rationalization.
```
I = disciplined + honest + optimistic + ...
```

To the determinists: it sure doesn't feel like it.

World is not zero-sum. Sam Altman. Jules Verne.

The "I" answer provides the inescapable context by which we answer the "what" and the "why". 

This is not about me. This article, my life, everything. From what I hear. It makes no sense.

Who am I, what am I doing and Why?

I want people to think I'm smart. I can't help it. I can help it. Why do I want people to think I'm smart? I want the world to be well ordered. This is the sorting algorithm I've chosen. This is the sorting algorithm that has been strongly suggested to me.

```
I = x ∙ (smartness factor) + y ∙ (humor factor) + z ∙ (german heritage factor) + ...
```

What things do I wrap up into my ego? My sense of self? Why? Should I? Paul Graham provided me with a taxonomy for thinking about these questions in an [essay of his](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html). His main point: keep your identity small (it's the title). If you wrap up your political beliefs into your sense of self, then anyone who challenges them is not challenging these ideas (which of course could be wrong), they are challenging YOU in the most personal sense. If you allow the falsification of a belief that is wrapped up in your sense of self then you have to completely readjust the equation `I`. Rebalancing that equation is tough. And painful.

Graham takes this reasoning to its logical conclusion: "...then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible." Graham is mostly referring here to "things" like Proper noun labels: democrat, republican, christian, muslim etc. I've extended the notion and consequently adjusted my strategy. The real issue here are labels that come with their own bag of beliefs: dogma. Certainly these days people would say that to be a "democrat" means to hold some set of beliefs. We typically think of only religion when we think of Dogma. But as David Foster Wallace has said: "Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship". It is this Choice that matters so much. This choice mirrors Graham's advice on what to wrap up into our identity. This Choice of where we "tap real meaning in life" has the power to "eat you alive."

1. I have X choices a day.
2. I have the choice to percieve something a certain way.
3. Humans are weak. Default settings cut down choices a day. Habits.

How to pay attention. What gets my attention? Where do I derive meaning. All different kinds of freedom. Attention and awareness and discipline. So hidden in plain sight all the time. 

Tolstoy

## This is water
didactic parabolic stories. The most obvious important realities are the most difficult to see or talk about. Banal platitudes have immense importance. Not about how to think, but about the choice about what to think about. Skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.

2 people, same experience, even "agreed" reasoning -> different conclusion. Different templates for understanding the world. 

How we construct meaning is a matter of choice. 

Blind certainty -> loving captors syndrom. Default setting, we are the center of the universe. The world happens around me. The inevitability of my context. How do we get rid of this default setting. "well adjusted". Wallace feared getting lost in these abstract arguments, over-intellectualizing things. Choose what to pay attention to, choose how to construct meaning.

Petty little frustrating crap is where the art of choosing how to think. Think about how deeply and personally unfair this is. Thinking this way is easy and automatic. Aware enough to give yourself a choice. The mystical oneness of all things deep down. Capital T True is the choice what to percieve. We all worship something. Some things eat us alive. Money. Being Smart. Body. Codified as myths, parables. Trick: keeping the truth up in daily conciousness. Measuring value according to these default settings. Attention and awareness and discipline. Simple. awareness. So hidden in plain site all the time.

So miserable though we've been so lucky. New baseline. How do you rebel against anarchy?
