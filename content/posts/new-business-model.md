I think the world needs the internet to come up with a new business model. I'm referring to the internet's de-facto business model: advertising. i.e. driving would-be customers towards company X's products. The incentives that such a model produces often run directly against the interests of the user and oftentimes the claimed motivations of the company. This thought isn't novel in the slightest, but I'm going to take a second to dive into it.

h4. First off, what's so bad about advertising?
To ask whether advertising is good or bad is to set up a false dichotomy. Advertising as a motivation coexists in the infinite +grey area+ that is our ethical spectrum. We each decide where to draw the good/bad line. It may used for good as a means of directly manufacturing value. It is direct because it targets perception and the beliefs that influence that perception as oppose to the product or service itself. Improving the product is a means of indirectly affecting that perception (or failing to). To think this unethical somewhat implies there is an objective intrinsic value of the product and advertising that suggests the product is more (or less?) valuable than it is, is unethical. A long-winded way of saying we often think willful misrepresentation of the value of something for the purpose of personal gain is wrong. But the operative and very wishy-washy word here, value, forces me to throw up my hands and acknowledge advertising can create value from nothing and hell, sometimes thats good. 

h4. Ok, then what's so bad about an internet advertising business model?
This question is more to the point. This business model usually manifests itself online with images of products or banners selling services being displayed on sites that may only be tangentially related to said products. The site then gets paid for how many people they get these ads in front of and how many of them click on them. Pretty simple. So lets boil down the strategy of the business. The main goal: maximizing profit.
