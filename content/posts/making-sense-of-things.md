This is my take on making sense of things.

Making sense of things is hard business. Broadly speaking it's trying to answer the ole Who, What, Why: Who am I, What am I doing and Why am I doing that. There is a natural ordering of entailment here. That is, you can't really answer the "why" without defining a) what it is you are doing and b) the subject "I". Of course (b) is frequently glossed over. From a simple definitional stance, the question "Why am I doing what I'm doing" makes no sense without (a) and (b). I've typically never thought about it like this. I've usually started with the "what". But I've come to realize the "I" question is very important and should probably be answered first. 

Now before I dive in here let me just say this: pondering these existential questions is a luxury I have. I am a white heterosexual male born in the U.S. (Illinois in fact, where even the animals will smile at you when you pass). This affords me a context and vantage rarely impinged. I'll touch on this briefly.

### Why `I` first?
```
I = intelligence + humor + german + midwesterner + good soccer player + catholic + handsome + ... 
```

This equation makes no sense. Stay with me here. These are some examples of things I have historically wrapped up into my identity, my ego, my concept of self. The wishy-washy-ness of those variables is a problem. Namely, if I find myself doubting my intelligence I am actually doubting myself. That's painful. My realization that I'm not the best soccer player on the field led to the thought "I guess I'm not the 'good soccer player' here." Simplistic but the point: our evaluation of those metrics depend on how we compare to others (we tend to be very zero sum thinkers - more on that later). 

I want people to think I'm smart. Clearly I'd benefit from a world where people thought I was smart. It was an imposed ordering of the world when I was younger. As a child I was given a letter grade and there was ordering amongst myself and my classmates. In highschool, the resolution increased: I was given a GPA and now you could effectively rank every kid in the school. Now, I'm not taking issue with the education system here, I'm pointing out that this way of conceptualizing the world and your place in it takes a toll. I was socialized in the  U.S. which is an incredibly competitive culture. It is the inner sanctum of capitalism. Quick pause: I'm not decrying capitalism here. Its likely our best approximation of an economy that can sustain progress and provide citizens with opportunity and social mobility (in it's ideal, thats certainly not how the currently levied system works). Capitalism and its underlying axioms have imbued our culture and its subscribers with a fierce competitive drive. My point is descriptive, not normative: this has produced many `Iₓ` with operands like `intelligence` or `attraction`, where `x ∈ {set of all people, including YOU and ME}`. 

I haven't been too explicit as to why these things are dangerous. I think they are dangerouse because they prime us, anchor our perception. We view the world from our own position, smack dab in the center (as far as we're concerned). David Foster Wallace makes this point in his ["This is Water"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI) commencement speach at Kenyon college in 2005: "everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe... it is our Default setting." We percieve the world as it is happening to US. And we interpret the world in our relation to it, which is largely defined by `I`. And that is the crucial realization: how we make sense of the world, wrangle meaning from it, is crucially dependent on the things we wrap into our identity and the beliefs those things entail. If I wrap intelligence into my identity, I'm primed to dismiss ideas that admit my own failures. If I wrap up a laden ideology into my identity, such as being a democrat or republican, then when someone challenges an idea derived from that idealogy, they aren't just challenging that idea, but ME in the most personal sense. Falsfication of that idea would require a rebalancing of `I`, which is by all accounts a painful process. DFW tells a short parable in his speech of an atheist and theist: the athiest has just recounted a brush with death while camping. He was lost during a winter storm and he dropped to his knees and prayed to God for his life. The theist responds "well you must believe now! You're alive!". The athiest says no, he got back because a couple eskimos happened to walk by. We get two different meanings constructed from the same exact situation. The upshot here is that it's our choice: What to wrap into our identities, How to interpret the raw information our senses recieve. 

### Ok then, how to define `I`?

Now, this is a tough one. It of course is quite dependent on the context imposed on us as we grow. I might step into some logically dubious territory here. If its all the same to you, I request you gloss over that. You see, deciding on the values with which to define `I` (because indeed, `I` is synonomous with what we value, how we construct meaning) seems to be a chicken or the egg situation, some circular logic: we choose to value X only because X is already in the equation! 

It is here where we admit some objective authoritative voice. Typically this is in pursuit of the golden chalice, the ultimate great goal: the "capital T Truth" (as DFW puts it). There are plenty of places you can go for this. And as DFW puts it: "Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship." He goes on to say that the motivation for subbing in some religion here, Allah, Jesus or the Wicken mother goddess, is that most other choices will "eat you alive". He states this as an absolute Truth: worship intelligence and you will always feel a fraud, your beauty and you will "die a thousand deaths before they plant you". The hardline I've taken is a hard line indeed. But the choice here is decidedly in the grey area. DFW finishes the unbelieving atheist parable with the following assessment: "the religious dogmatist problem is exactly the same as the stories unbeliever: blind certainty". And so we arrive at my first rule: `I` will not contain anything that entails blind certainty. This of course means accepting a pretty bleak Truth. A Truth about Truth. That feels like the closest we can get. The beauty comes with the freedom to choose. The prevailing uncertainty allows us the opportunity to choose how to percieve something. This takes discipline and patience. Another rule has been alluded to. Exclude all things that feel like competition on the wrong dimension, any transient fact that manifests itself as unsubstantiated confidence, e.g. your beauty or smarts.

So I've decided on things to avoid incorporating into my sense of self. The question remains, what to include? Well, the [smaller the better](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html).

#### What now?

#### How? Not so subtle.

Here are some facts I maintain about myself.

#### Heavens why?

Some of you might be wondering why were answering "why" after "what". Or perhaps, that we basically already did the "why" thinking. Well now we have a change to engage in the all too human endeavor of post-hoc rationalization.
```
I = disciplined + honest + optimistic + ...
```

To the determinists: it sure doesn't feel like it.

World is not zero-sum. Sam Altman. Jules Verne.

The "I" answer provides the inescapable context by which we answer the "what" and the "why". 

This is not about me. This article, my life, everything. From what I hear. It makes no sense.

Who am I, what am I doing and Why?

I want people to think I'm smart. I can't help it. I can help it. Why do I want people to think I'm smart? I want the world to be well ordered. This is the sorting algorithm I've chosen. This is the sorting algorithm that has been strongly suggested to me.

```
I = x ∙ (smartness factor) + y ∙ (humor factor) + z ∙ (german heritage factor) + ...
```

What things do I wrap up into my ego? My sense of self? Why? Should I? Paul Graham provided me with a taxonomy for thinking about these questions in an [essay of his](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html). His main point: keep your identity small (it's the title). If you wrap up your political beliefs into your sense of self, then anyone who challenges them is not challenging these ideas (which of course could be wrong), they are challenging YOU in the most personal sense. If you allow the falsification of a belief that is wrapped up in your sense of self then you have to completely readjust the equation `I`. Rebalancing that equation is tough. And painful.

Graham takes this reasoning to its logical conclusion: "...then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible." Graham is mostly referring here to "things" like Proper noun labels: democrat, republican, christian, muslim etc. I've extended the notion and consequently adjusted my strategy. The real issue here are labels that come with their own bag of beliefs: dogma. Certainly these days people would say that to be a "democrat" means to hold some set of beliefs. We typically think of only religion when we think of Dogma. But as David Foster Wallace has said: "Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship". It is this Choice that matters so much. This choice mirrors Graham's advice on what to wrap up into our identity. This Choice of where we "tap real meaning in life" has the power to "eat you alive."

1. I have X choices a day.
2. I have the choice to percieve something a certain way.
3. Humans are weak. Default settings cut down choices a day. Habits.

How to pay attention. What gets my attention? Where do I derive meaning. All different kinds of freedom. Attention and awareness and discipline. So hidden in plain sight all the time.

## This is water
didactic parabolic stories. The most obvious important realities are the most difficult to see or talk about. Banal platitudes have immense importance. Not about how to think, but about the choice about what to think about. Skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.

2 people, same experience, even "agreed" reasoning -> different conclusion. Different templates for understanding the world. 

How we construct meaning is a matter of choice.  choose how to construct meaning from experience.

Blind certainty -> loving captors syndrom. Default setting, we are the center of the universe. The world happens around me. The inevitability of my context. How do we get rid of this default setting. "well adjusted". Wallace feared getting lost in these abstract arguments, over-intellectualizing things. Choose what to pay attention to, choose how to construct meaning.

Petty little frustrating crap is where the art of choosing how to think. Think about how deeply and personally unfair this is. Thinking this way is easy and automatic. Aware enough to give yourself a choice. The mystical oneness of all things deep down. Capital T True is the choice what to percieve. We all worship something. Some things eat us alive. Money. Being Smart. Body. Codified as myths, parables. Trick: keeping the truth up in daily conciousness. Measuring value according to these default settings. Attention and awareness and discipline. Simple. awareness. So hidden in plain site all the time.

So miserable though we've been so lucky. New baseline. How do you rebel against anarchy?

templates and beliefs

religious dogmatist problem is exactly the same as the stories unbeliever: blind certainty.
