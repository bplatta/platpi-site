The internet has democratized the ability to say something meaningful. My question, when will it democratize the ability to do something? What will that look like?

There are few operant words ands phrases I should unpack to make sense of that sentence: what does 'democratized' mean here? What does it mean to say something 'meaningful'? What sorts of things am I talking about when I say 'do something'?

#### Democratize

Lowering the cost of something such that more people can attain. Goods or actions.
