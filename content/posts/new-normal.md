Our notions of normal change faster now than they ever have in the history of the human race. Change is often carried by the messenger, the one with new information. This takes many forms: new scientific findings, a new perspective or framework for ordering the world. The speed at which information has been propogated accelerated at an accelerating rate with inventions like the telegraph and telephone. The internet is the new standard and the stakes are high. We should question whether the internet is currently operating as a platform for positive change. Should the current *normal* make us uncomfortable?

### So what's normal now? 
Now, people consume their information from the internet. The variable being optimized now is not so much speed (except of course for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading">HFT firms</a>), but information content and medium. If change is potentially marshalled at the speed of light now, we should be questioning the platforms through which information flows. We know content is optimized for its audience and we should ask: "to what end?". It is normal to acquiesce and allow companies the priviledge of our personal information. We do this for free services. Which are mostly fantastic I must say. We don't have a notion of the value of that data. It might as well not exist. Google's 2015 <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp">ebitda</a> (basically, net income) was 25 billion. Their market cap was about 520 billion. They were trading 20 times their net income! I'm no finance guy but I've got to ask - what makes them so valuable?

The world needs the internet to come up with a new business model. I'm referring to the internet's de-facto business model, advertising. That is, driving would-be customers towards company X's products. The incentives that such a model produces often run directly against the interests of the user and oftentimes the claimed motivations of the company.

#### What's so bad about advertising?
To ask whether advertising is good or bad is to set up a false dichotomy. Advertising as a motivation lies in the infinite *grey area* that is our ethical spectrum. We each decide where to draw the good/bad line. It may used for good as a means of directly manufacturing value. It is direct because it targets perception and the beliefs that influence that perception as oppose to the product or service itself. Improving the product is a means of indirectly affecting that perception (or failing to). Rory Sutherland lays this out in his <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man">TED talk</a> (one of the good ones). To think this unethical somewhat implies there is an objective intrinsic value of the product and advertising that strays from that value is unethical. Which is a long-winded way of saying we often think willful misrepresentation of the value of something for the purpose of personal gain is wrong. But the operative and very wishy-washy and subjective word here, value, forces me to throw up my hands and acknowledge advertising can create value from nothing and hell, sometimes thats good. 

#### What's so bad about an internet advertising business model?
This question is more to the point. This business model usually manifests itself online with images of products or banners selling services being displayed on sites that may only be tangentially related to said products. The site then gets paid for how many people they get these ads in front of and how many of them click on them. Pretty simple. So lets boil down the strategy of the business. The main goal: maximizing profit. If the aim is to maximize clicks on advertising than the application will
